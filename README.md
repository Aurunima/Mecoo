### Menopause
Menopause is the time that marks the end of a woman’s menstrual cycles.

#### It may result from:
- Naturally declining reproductive hormones.
- Surgery that removes the ovaries (oophorectomy).
- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
- Primary ovarian insufficiency. (Premature menopause)

#### Symptoms:
- Hot flash
- Chills
- Excessive sweating
- Difficulty sleeping
- Brain Fog

#### Present problem?
Our healthcare system doesn’t seem to cater to menopause as it should.\
A recent study showed that 73% of women don’t seek treatment for their menopause symptoms.\
Further, an estimation demonstrates that only 6% of women seeking menopause symptom treatment actually get it.

#### Current Medical Solutions
- Hormone Therapy
- Supplements
- Phenology Gummies
